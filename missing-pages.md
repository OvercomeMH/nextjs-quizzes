1. `/quizzes` - Quizzes list page
   - Referenced in navigation menu from dashboard

2. `/admin/quizzes` - Admin quizzes list page
   - Referenced as "Back to Quizzes" in admin pages
   - Used as redirect after quiz creation

## Implementation Priority

1. `/quizzes` - High priority (main user navigation)
2. `/admin/quizzes` - High priority (needed for admin quiz management)
3. `/admin/quizzes/[id]/edit` - Medium priority (needed for quiz modifications)
4. `/admin/users/*` - Lower priority (user management features)
